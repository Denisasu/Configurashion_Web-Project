<td><p>
    Two sub-steps are used to identify the functionality provided by existing applications. The first sub-step,
    coarse-grained mapping, maps business processes to the portfolio of existing applications. The second sub-step,
    fine-grained mapping, involves mapping a service to a specific transaction or batch process within the legacy
    application. Fine-grained mapping is done during service specification.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of coarse-grained mapping is to derive the preliminary, i.e. initial, mapping of business functions to
    services.
</p>
<p>
    In order to identify candidate services from functionality in existing applications, the relationship between the
    business process and existing applications must be understood. This can be described as coarse-grained mapping. This
    mapping is between the business activities or business processes and the business functions of existing applications as
    shown below.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="275" alt="" src="./../../soa.rup_soma/tasks/resources/Technique-Fig40.gif" width="319" />
</p>
<p>
    To capture the relationships between business processes and existing applications, we perform the following
    coarse-grained mapping steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Understand the business functions supported by each application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
        Typically a business function can be mapped to an activity within a business process.
    </li>
    <li>
        Record attributes of existing applications in terms of technologies used, architectural styles, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify applications that perform common services.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Coarse-grained mapping and application portfolio analysis
</h4>
<p>
    Understanding the business value and the technical quality of existing applications helps in creating a
    transformational plan with highest priority given to the highest value services, and to assess scope and technical
    risks based on the technical qualities of the application, for example, degree of coupling.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="230" alt="" src="./../../soa.rup_soma/tasks/./resources/Technique-Fig41.gif" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    Application portfolio analysis provides scope and boundaries for coarse-grain mapping. For example, applications with
    minimal business value or low technical value which are targeted for obsolescence would probably not be in scope for
    candidate service identification.
</p>
<p>
    Application portfolio analysis, if performed, may provide information about existing services for coarse-grained
    mapping. The output of this analysis is candidate services as shown below.

    Independent Software Vendor (ISV) packages are commonly implemented to enable subsystems and/or service components
    within an organization. For example, comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) ISV packages, such as those
    offered by SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle, are often implemented as complete systems comprising multiple subsystems that
    fully support one or more Domains within an organization. This section describes a series of steps that will enable the
    practitioner to identify functionality and candidate services within existing ISV packages. This analysis will enable
    the Business Function/System Matrix, Business Rules Catalog and Service Model work products to be populated based on
    the capabilities of the existing ISV packages.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note</b>: Because each ISV package is different, it is not possible to develop a detailed prescriptive approach for
    each one. The following activities describe a generic approach and a generic set of activities that will:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify candidate services within ISV packages.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the high-level characteristics of the ISV packages that will be considered during service realization.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    ISV Package Identification
</h4>
<p>
    Ideally, ISV packages for the in-scope domains and business components should have been identified in the CBM System to
    Business Component Overlay input (or equivalent). This would result in a list of ISV packages that enable functionality
    within the specific business components in the scope of the envisioned solution. If this input is missing, the ISV
    packages that support the in scope domains and business components will have to be identified and mapped to business
    components.
</p>
<p>
    Note that some ISV packages, such as SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle, are comprised of a number of core and optional
    modules. For example, SAP has a manufacturing module, human resources module and customer relationship management
    module. In these cases, it is important to specify which specific modules of the ISV packages are being used. This will
    result in a more focused analysis that will save time and avoid unnecessary services proliferation.
</p>
<h4>
    ISV Package Categorization
</h4>
<p>
    Categorization of ISV Packages provides high-level insight into important characteristics that will need to be
    considered during service realization (this applies to both functional and technical components). ISVs can be
    categorized as Tier 1, 2 or 3 ISVs based on characteristics such as their core competencies, size and revenue as
    summarized in table 10. Note in particular the Technical Impact and Business Impact aspects.

<p>
    Since ISV packages are used within virtually every organization, most service-oriented solutions will incorporate
    services realized through Service Components based on ISV packages. Categorizing these ISV packages will enable the
    practitioner to understand the role and relative importance of these packages within the SOA solution, and also
    identify technical and functional characteristics that will be considered during service realization.
</p>
<p>
    For each ISV package, an understanding in the following areas is obtained through the analysis performed during
    categorization:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        An understanding of the significance and influence of this ISV package within the enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>
        The propensity to realize any new services through this ISV package.
    </li>
    <li>
        The architecture standards and technical components used within the ISV package and their role within the
        enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>
        An understanding of the middleware and technical components compatible with the ISV package.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Analyze Options for Service Access within ISV Packages
</h4>
<p>
    This step identifies the mechanisms by which functions within the ISV packages can be accessed (i.e. technical aspects
    of the package directly related to service exposure and realization). This information is used to help identify
    candidate services within the ISV packages (in the next step) and will also be used later for assessing technical
    feasibility and making service realization decisions.
</p>
<p>
    Several mechanisms may be used to access ISV packages. During this step, each in scope package is analyzed to determine
    and describe which mechanisms are available for each package. In general, ISV packages will support one or more of the
    following mechanisms:

                developed to enable access to functionality through the API.

                 <i>Note: While this approach may be technically feasible, bypassing business logic within the ISV package
                introduces a potential risk of corrupting data or violating program enforced data integrity. For this
                reason, it is recommended that this technique be restricted to services that perform “read-only”
                operations. Even so, this approach is still at risk due to potential changes to the ISV’s data schema, and
                should therefore be used with great caution.</i>

<h4>
    ISV Packages Service Identification Techniques
</h4>
<p>
    During this step, several techniques are used to analyze the ISV packages and identify functionality that can
    potentially be exposed as a service. Business rules associated with the functionality are also identified. Each
    technique is used to assess packages from a different perspective, enabling the packages to be thoroughly analyzed for
    candidate services. Analysis results are captured in the Business Function/System Matrix and Business Rules Catalog
    work products. As with the other SOMA identification activities, candidate services are added to the Service Portfolio
    and Service Hierarchy.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Review the ISV packages’ catalogue of pre-defined services<br />
        <br />
         Some ISV packages offer a catalogue of pre-defined services. If so, candidate services for the in-scope Domains
        and Business Components are identified through the catalogue and added to the Service Portfolio. If supported by
        the ISV, this technique represents the easiest way to identify candidate services using the ISV packages.<br />
        <br />
         <b>Note</b>: During the SOMA Specification step, the degree of granularity of these services will be considered as
        part of making service exposure decisions. Hence it is important to capture the degree of granularity as a
        characteristic of candidate services during SOMA Identification. It may be necessary to aggregate or decompose
        exposed services depending upon the degree to which they align with the services realized within the ISV packages.
        This analysis also helps align candidate services within the service hierarchy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the ISV packages’ APIs<br />
        <br />
         ISV packages may offer one or more APIs that can be used to access functionality within the packages. These APIs
        are examined for the in-scope Domains and Business Components to identify candidate services to be added to the
        service portfolio. Since functionality accessible through these APIs will not natively be offered as a service, a
        service wrapper or façade will need to be developed to expose these API calls as services. The flexibility of this
        approach enables the combination of two or more API calls within a single service, which may enable services within
        the packages to be developed to align with services in the service hierarchy. In this case, the practitioner
        identifies services within the service hierarchy and maps these to the supporting functionality and API calls
        within the packages.

        Review ISV business process maps and workflow<br />
        <br />
         The business processes and workflow enabled by an ISV packages may be documented in either a hard copy of
        electronic format. These artifacts are examined to identify additional candidate services for addition to the
        service portfolio. Specifically, this review should take an end-to-end view of business processes within the
        packages as well as the workflow context in which the process is executed. This enables any related candidate
        services to be identified and also identifies business process and workflow considerations that need to be
        considered during service realization.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify ISV packages’ service boundaries<br />
        <br />
         An ISV package is developed to support business processes and manage data with a scope that is aligned with
        Business Components (Functional Areas) and Domains. These Business Components form the “footprint” or “service
        boundary” for the ISV packages. However, within a specific enterprise, the ISV package may be implemented within a
        subset of the overall service boundary for that package. By identifying the overall service boundary for the ISV
        package, the practitioner determines if additional services within the package’s service boundary should be added
        to the Service Portfolio. More importantly, the practitioner can determine if new services that are required should
        be realized through the ISV packages<br />
        <br />
         If it is determined that new services are required to enable the service-oriented solution, the practitioner
        should determine if these services fall within the service boundary for the ISV package. If they do, services
        within the ISV package that support the required functionality are identified and added to the Service Portfolio.
        This enables the solution to leverage the full capabilities of the ISV package, and reduces the risk of developing
        duplication within multiple systems supporting the same Business Component.
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze data elements controlled within the ISV packages<br />
        <br />
         The data elements within the scope of the solution are assessed to determine if they are managed within the ISV
        packages. If data is managed within the ISV packages, other business processes within the packages that read or
        update the same data are analyzed for candidate services to add to the Service Portfolio.<br />
        <br />
         This analysis also reveals related or external processes and interfaces that may be affected by the solution and
        that must be considered during service realization. These are documented and assessed during service realization.
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze ISV security and other technical components<br />
        <br />
         Many ISV packages contain their own security components for authentication and authorization and may contain other
        technical components that support functions such as logging and messaging. For each package, these components are
        identified and analyzed to identify candidate technical services that may be added to the Service Portfolio.<br />
        <br />
         In addition, during this analysis, any issues or constraints that may be introduced by these components are
        identified for consideration during service realization. For example, the interaction required with the package’s
        security components to access functionality within the package must be understood and accommodated during service
        realization.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Applying these various analysis techniques will enable candidate services within the in-scope ISV packages to be
    identified from several different perspectives. It will also identify issues and constraints introduced by the
    functional and technical components of the ISV packages that must be considered during service realization.

<td><p>
    When documenting Non-Functional Requirements for existing assets the following key topics need to be considered.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Exception Handling</b> - We need to understand how exception handling works today. In batch processing, when
        exception occurs, the program abends (abnormally terminates) and produces a core dump. The programmer is required
        to look at the core dump and figure out what needs to be done. This may not be acceptable. One would need to figure
        out what needs to be done, for instance, and how to integrate with exception handling framework.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Process and Data Distribution</strong> - We need to examine where the data and process are executed. CICS
        application executing on one machine may send a request to another machine (also known as function shipping in
        CICS) or remote call data on another machine. We may like to consider going directly (JDBC to DB) to remote machine
        where the process or data is running, instead of using the connector which goes through the JDBC to DB.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Availability</strong> - If we have customer file in VSAM which requires, say, a 4 hour maintenance
        window, then we can't support 24/7 customer service. We would need to consider a new storage solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Authorization/Authentication</strong> - Many legacy applications have authorization and authentication
        mechanisms in the application code. This would require migrating user access management to federated managed
        environment supported by best practices.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Staging Delays</strong> - Typically batch programs run once a day in the night. If requirements are to run
        the program more often, then we will have to modify the schedule program to change the frequency.
