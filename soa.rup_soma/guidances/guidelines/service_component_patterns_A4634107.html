    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    In decomposing a service component into its constituent functional and technical components, we have delegated the
    functionality provided by the service component to fulfill the subsystem’s functional responsibilities. Functional
    components supply the business functionality required, while technical components provide generic functionality such as
    authentication, error handling, auditing, logging, etc which are operational and non-functional oriented.
</p>
<p>
    A service model is a design-time artifact. As such, it does not deal directly with the implementation of services.
    However, the actual implementation of a service or set of services is strictly performed by a service component's
    realization of a service specification. The service specification provides the implementation contract; the technology
    or techniques used to implement the service are irrelevant as long as the contract is fulfilled. In the concept <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/concepts/service-oriented_architecture_8328ABAD.html" guid="8.613638237693525E-307"><em>Service-Oriented Architecture</em></a>, we introduced the following picture
    demonstrating the relationship between the services we identify and the components and objects that provide the
    implementation of these services.
</p>
<p align="center">
    &nbsp;<img height="241" alt="Diagram described in associated text" src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/concepts/resources/co_soa_soa-01.gif"     width="241" />
</p>
<p>
    In this way, we can see how the RUP <i><a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_design_model_2830034D.html" guid="{8CDAEAD4-5E84-4F50-87FD-3240ED047DE7}">Design
    Model</a></i> can be used to capture the design of the component and object layers, with implementation models and
    artifacts capturing details of the object layer and associated implementation and deployment artifacts. Important
    aspects of the relationship between the <i><a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/workproducts/soa_service_model_623494B9.html" guid="{E24679B7-19F1-483B-A1F1-578839C43888}">Service Model</a></i> and the component design model are that the set of
    service specifications represent contracts that must be fulfilled, operations identified on specifications must be
    implemented as-is, and that consumers of services are using this same model to understand the interface and behavior of
    the services they expect to use. As such, there is a direct and in general a one-to-one relationship between the
    service specification and some implementation artifact that acts as the initial implementation entry point for the
    service.
</p>
<p>
    For example, consider the following diagram of a service provider showing the details of model elements used in its
    definition.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="139" alt="Diagram is described in the textual content." src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svce_components-02.gif"     width="246" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    The key to the use of the service component is that it should be directly traceable to the service model. The easiest
    way to accomplish this is to make use of the fact that the service specification element is a UML Interface that can be
    realized by the service component, thus ensuring its conformance to the structural specification. In this way we would
    get the following result:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="74" alt="Diagram is described in the textual content." src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svce_components-03.gif"     width="406" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    It is now the responsibility of the component implementer to define a set of components and classes that provide the
    behavior of the resulting component.
</p>
<h3>
    Kinds of Service Components
</h3>
<h4>
    Functional Components
</h4>
<p>
    The composition of these functional components into a larger-grained service component is not merely structural; it
    also involves the definition of flow, that is, the collaboration of the functional components to provide functionality
    to support the business processes. As we have seen earlier, the functionality of these business-related components is
    enabled through the services (implemented by the component’s finer level object or legacy system structure) defined.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to note that this step includes traditional OOAD activities. We have a focused and well-partitioned
    scope to direct the object design. In traditional object-oriented design, we tend to create larger more dependent
    object graphs, whereas if subsystem analysis follows the identification of functional areas within the business, we
    have a very clearly defined scope to focus on and direct our design energies towards. These results in a set of more
    loosely coupled object models (class diagrams and sequence diagrams triggered by system use cases).
</p>

    Technical components
</h4>

<h3>
    Service Component Patterns
</h3>
<p>
    Having said that the service component simply realizes the service specification does not provide the implementer with
    much assistance in going from a coarse-grained service definition to a set of fine-grained implementation classes and
    artifacts required to provide the behavior of the service. In this regard, it is common to rely on patterns that
    provide structure to the resulting service component, either as a starting framework or specific patterns to address
    particular policy requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Pattern choice, driven by NFR, architecture [more]
</p>
<p>
    Note that the additional stereotypes introduced here are described in the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/workproducts/soa_svce_component_E259F3CC.html" guid="{447385A0-E565-4C87-A082-402AF21CA088}">Artifact: Service Component</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Base Service Component Pattern
</h4>
<p>
    In defining the initial structure of a service, the following pattern is provided as a starting point for customization
    and completion.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="106" alt="Diagram is described in the textual content." src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svce_components-04.gif"     width="578" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    The elements of the pattern are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Facade Component</b>; the facade realizes the same interface as the service component itself and provides basic
        capabilities for message validation before passing the request on to the per-operation components for execution. In
        this case we stereotype the component as &lt;&lt;facade&gt;&gt; for clarification.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Per-Operation Component</b>; given the granularity of services, it is useful in most cases to have a separate
        component/class for the implementation of each operation provided by the service.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following demonstrates the composite structure view of this pattern. In this case, the facade is delegated to by
    the service component itself. As such, consumers calling operations on the service component are actually serviced by
    the facade component. Note that it would be possible to use UML 2.0 ports as well to expose the interfaces and make
    this delegation explicit using connectors.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="119" alt="Diagram is described in the textual content." src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svce_components-05.gif"     width="274" border="0" />
</p>
<h4>
    Single Operation Service Component Pattern
</h4>
<p>
    In some cases where services are identified in the Service Model with multiple operations, it is more appropriate to
    implement the operations individually as stand-alone services separating the logical service and physical service
    views. Such a pattern has advantages in terms of flexibility of sourcing, high availability, versioning, and evolution
    but does lose the notion of an interface to a service as a set of related operations.
</p>
<p>
    Modeling service components according to this pattern has a single &lt;&lt;Service Component&gt;&gt; realizing a single
    interface with a single operation, all named according to common conventions and demonstrated below.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="113" alt="Diagram is described in the textual content." src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svce_components-12.gif"     width="394" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    In this case, as we mentioned, there is no direct realization of the original service specification by any one element
    in the pattern above. Therefore, it seems worthwhile to introduce an element in the model that can provide traceability
    back to the service specification. In the example below, we have introduced a component, stereotyped
    &lt;&lt;subsystem&gt;&gt; that is noted as implementing the service specification and also owning the elements
    described above.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="49" alt="Diagram is described in the textual content." src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svce_components-11.gif"     width="326" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    This pattern also does not introduce the &lt;&lt;facade&gt;&gt; component because consumers of the services are
    responsible for identifying the services they use.
</p>
<h4>
    Mediated Operation Pattern
</h4>
<p>
    Where there is the possibility that a service consumer's request may be routed to one of a selection of operation
    components for execution, it is possible to extend the pattern with a mediator to route these messages, as shown below.
    Note we stereotype the component/class as &lt;&lt;mediator&gt;&gt; for clarification. The exact mechanism used for
    mediation is undefined. A static set of implementations could be known ahead of time, a registry of some sort could
    also be used to map to the particular implementation based on the consumer, content of the request message, and so
    forth. This pattern is not intended for use with the single-operation pattern shown above.

</p>
<p>
    This also affects the composite structure view of the service component; as shown below, the mediator connection is
    shown from the facade which uses it to direct calls to the operation components.

</p>
<p>
    If a registry, external to the mediator itself, is used, it is not necessarily possible to show static usage
    dependencies from the mediator to the operation components or connectors between parts in the composite structure
    diagram. So, how can we model a dependency from the mediator to the mediated operation components? In the following
    diagram, we have introduced an interface to be implemented by each operation component. We can then model the usage
    from the mediator to the interface, as shown below.

</p>
<p>
    We also change the relationship in the composite structure diagram, including a new part typed by the interface, and
    denote the multiplicity between the mediator and operation components on the connector, as shown below.

<h4>
    Data Access Components
</h4>
<p>
    Additionally, where service operations share common data requirements, it may be useful to highlight the specific
    components providing data management capabilities to the implementation. Note we stereotype the component/class as
    &lt;&lt;data access&gt;&gt; for clarification.

<h3>
    The Enterprise Component Pattern
</h3>
<p>
    The Enterprise Component Pattern below shows the service component acting as a facade for the underlying functional and
    technical components. Services are exposed on the edge of the service component at the component facade. Requests for
    services on the facade are forwarded to a mediator which then routes the message to the appropriate functional or
    technical component.
</p>

<p>
    The dependencies and needs of the functional components to the technical components, for the Rent-a-car example, are
    depicted below.

<p>
    The collection of subsystem component models is gathered into the functional component model which shows the reliance
    of the functional components on the technical components, and the inter-relationships between the functional components
    themselves. Leaf-level sub-processes that are assigned to the subsystem facade need to be specified as services the
    subsystem will provide. These sub-processes are supported and implemented through a finer grained set of system use
    cases encapsulated within the structure of the subsystem. The functional components are relied upon for the realization
    of the use cases. In turn the functional components depend on the technical components and utilities for their
    infrastructure needs.
