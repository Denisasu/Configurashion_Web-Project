<p>
    A service is the key artifact in a <i><a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/concepts/service-oriented_architecture_8328ABAD.html" guid="8.613638237693525E-307">Service-Oriented Architecture</a></i>, but what is a service? The following is the entry
    from the Rational Unified Process (RUP) glossary.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <i>A service is a software resource (discoverable) with an externalized service specification. This service
    specification is available for searching, binding, and invocation by a service consumer. The service provider realizes
    the service specification implementation and also delivers the quality of service requirements to the service consumer.
    Services shall be governed by declarative policies and thus support a dynamically re-configurable architectural
    style.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
    And, while the following section outlines some of the key statements in the entry above, it is worth noting an
    additional aspect of services that really differentiate them from design elements in previous technologies; services
    are at a level of granularity that allows them to be identified from a business level. Thus below we will also discuss
    the business aligned nature of services.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Discoverable" name="Discoverable">Discoverable</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Services are not a part of a monolithic application architecture. They exist independently at run time from any and all
    other services within a given solution. This means that we require a method for the registration and discovery of
    services based on criteria such as the&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/workproducts/soa_svce_model_svce_spec_37E89A91.html" guid="{20F06B5E-95D5-422C-AB68-7C213D28533A}">Artifact: Service Specification</a> it realizes, its <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/workproducts/soa_svce_model_svce_provider_C00D3410.html" guid="{8427751F-3C14-4CEB-9816-5112BDB91EED}">Artifact: Service Provider</a>, as well as other business and technical
    classifications. This discovery process may take place during development time to match given services to supporting
    services or it may take place at run time to enable the dynamic provisioning of services (mediated invocation). To be
    discoverable, a service must provide a set of metadata that allows categorization. This metadata is a part of the
    external specification.
</p>
<p>
    For more information, see the&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/concepts/service_portfolio_52FD64AC.html" guid="1.851952881072508E-305">Concept: Service Portfolio</a> and the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/service_mediation_2F2C4C02.html" guid="2.5614739075754752E-306">Guideline: Service Mediation</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Externally_Described" name="Externally_Described">Externally</a> Specified
</h4>
<p>
    The external specification allows for a service to publish its details such as interface, location, policies,
    classifications, and so on without the need for a client to have access to the service itself. Such information is then
    usually stored in a known location or specialized service registry that supports queries of the metadata. Currently in
    the Web Services world, the accepted standard for the description of service interfaces is WSDL (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">Web Services Description Language)</a>, which comes from the World Wide Web
    Consortium.
</p>
<p>
    The service specification work product is actually a combination of three parts: the interface, behavior, and policy
    specification. As such, the realization of these different aspects requires more than simply the interface definition
    provided by WSDL.
</p>
<p>
    For more information on service registries, see the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/concepts/service_portfolio_52FD64AC.html" guid="1.851952881072508E-305">Concept: Service Portfolio</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Contract_Based" name="Contract_Based">Contract-Based</a>
</h4>
<p>
    In the glossary definition above we noted that the service specification provides a view for both the service provider
    as well as the service consumer. These views correspond to two halves of a contract that allows the clear separation of
    the specification from implementation.
</p>
<p>
    The following table describes how the different aspects of a service specification affect both the provider and
    consumer of the specification.

<p>
    Such a service specification can be seen as an application of the Design by Contract but is a necessary step in
    achieving discoverable and dynamically reconfigurable services.

    <a id="Business_Aligned" name="Business_Aligned">Business Alignment</a>
</h4>
<p>
    In general, the connection between business models representing the operations of the business and the design models
    for supporting IT applications have been at best loosely connected. In most cases, they have been completely
    disconnected. While the RUP does provide guidance on the transition from business models to system use case models (see
    the guideline <i>Going from Business Models to Systems</i>), the connection requires a number of transformations as the
    level of granularity and abstraction changes from the business to IT perspectives.
</p>
<p>
    In general, it is clear that services may be classified into either business or infrastructure services. See the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/concepts/service_portfolio_52FD64AC.html" guid="1.851952881072508E-305">Concept: Service Portfolio</a>&nbsp;for a discussion of service classifications.
</p>
<p>
    One important aspect of SOA is that the level of granularity of services described in a service-oriented solution is
    such that the operations provided by services can often be identified at a business level. This increase in the level
    of granularity in supporting IT means that, in many cases, tasks identified in business-process models can be directly
    realized as operations on services. Therefore the business users of IT solutions become much more a part of the
    analysis and design process. It is also interesting to note that this closer connection with the business process model
    also more directly associates services as IT work products, with the <i>Business Goals</i> modeled in the RUP
    business-modeling discipline.

    The structure and composition view of the model capture the communication between services and the partitioning of the
    solution. This is addressed in the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/concepts/service_composition_and_choreography_41EDEECB.html" guid="7.723783423994501E-306">Concept: Service Composition and Choreography</a>&nbsp;and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/concepts/solution_partitioning_352116F8.html" guid="1.6501323286225543E-305">Concept: Solution Partitioning</a>.

<h5>
    Alternative Methods
</h5>
<p>
    As is often the case in modeling there are alternatives methods to model the same logical structure and in some cases
    the techniques can be used to represent additional technical details. For example in modeling the notion of both
    provided and required capabilities for a service we can either choose to stereotype the interfaces that describe these
    capabilities as Service Specifications and use an unstereotyped&nbsp;class to represent the combined type, or we can
    choose to stereotype the class itself and not the interfaces. Both of these options are shown in the figure below.
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
    In general you should stereotype the interfaces if they themselves are going to be used by other services in a
    different context, so the rule of thumb is that whichever element is considered the reusable description should be
    stereotyped. When creating a service on a service provider (in UML terms a port on either a class or component) you
    select either the ServiceType or MyService class as the type of the stereotyped port, as shown below.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="190" alt="" src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svc_model-02.png" width="336" />
</p>
<p>
    Note that the resulting structure will be identical for either ServiceType or MyService, the port indicates a required
    interface and a provided interface - possibly a callback interface which the client is required to provide. However, in
    some cases it is useful to explicitly separate out the required and provided capabilities into individual service
    descriptions. In this case we need two classes realizing the service specifications we introduced above. The figure
    below demonstrates these classes.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="144" alt="" src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svc_model-03.png" width="335" />
</p>
<p>
    Now, when we create our service provider we need two stereotyped ports, as shown below, one to represent the callin and
    one the callback capabilities.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="190" alt="" src="./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/./resources/soa_svc_model-04.png" width="336" />
</p>
<p>
    As for when you need this additional flexibility, it will depend very much on the task at hand and the level of
    formality you need to include in your models. The example at the end is very clear that there are separate notions of a
    callin and callback interface; however, what if the same provider implements&nbsp;a number of service end-points? The
    proliferation of ports may make the final result hard to read and understand.
