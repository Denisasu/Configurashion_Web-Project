<p>
    The User-Experience Storyboard flows of events can be included as scripts on the flow diagrams, or (if quite detailed)
    in separate documents. For more information on modeling the flow diagrams, see the <a href="#Modeling_the_User_Experience_Storyboard_Flow_Diagrams">Modeling the User-Experience Storyboard Flow
    Diagram(s)</a> section.
</p>
<p>
    The following are guidelines on how to describe a User-Experience Storyboard's flow of events textually:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Start with a user-interface-independent Use-Case Flow of Events.</b> The Use-Case Flow of Events should not
        contain any user interface details. This makes it easier to capture the <i>essence</i> of the Use Case, similar to
        the <a id="XE_use-case_storyboard__essential_use_cases,_use_in" name="XE_use-case_storyboard__essential_use_cases,_use_in"></a>"essential use cases" described in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/user-centered_design_3BE14873.html" guid="9.505306299650132E-305">Concept: User-Centered Design</a>.&nbsp; It is here, in the User-Experience
        Storyboard Flows of Events, that the user interface and usability aspects are added.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Keep action statements brief.</b> The description does not necessarily have to be self-contained, because it
        does not have to be comprehensible to people other than user-interface designers. Action statements that consist of
        brief steps give a better overview, since it makes the shorter. For example, when you describe how the system
        exchanges data with a user, you should keep the description brief and comprehensive; you can list the exchanged
        data at the end of the line, within parentheses: "create person (name, address, telephone)."
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Avoid sequences and modes.</b> Users can often perform the system features in different sequences, especially in
        user-interface-intensive systems where the user is in control. Sequences often imply modes of the user interface,
        and you should avoid modes if possible. Thus, you should specify only the sequences that are mandatory. For
        example, that the user must identify himself before he can withdraw money from an ATM, or that the system must show
        the invoices to the user, before the user can accept or refuse them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Be consistent with the Use Case.</b> Since the User-Experience Storyboard can be described more or less in
        parallel with a corresponding Use Case, these two artifacts should be kept consistent with, and give feedback to,
        each other. In particular, the User-Experience Storyboard flow of events should be kept consistent with the
        associated use-case flow of events. Note that this often requires an extensive communication and feedback loop
        between the person responsible for the Use Case and the person responsible for the User-Experience Storyboard.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Example:&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
    The following is an example of a flow of events for a "Bid on Item" Use Case, augmented with the User-Experience
    Element names (shown in <i><font color="#FF0080">italics</font></i>):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Buyer indicates that he would like to place a bid on the displayed item.<br />
         The system displays the <font color="#FF0080"><i>Bid on Item Input Form</i></font>, so that the Buyer can enter
        the bid information.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Buyer submits his information.<br />
         If the entered bid is valid the system displays a <i><font color="#FF0080">Bid Confirmation Screen</font></i>,
        which contains the entered bid information.<br />
         If the entered bid is invalid the <font color="#FF0080"><i>Bid on Item Input Form</i></font> message is
        re-displayed and an "invalid bid" message is displayed.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<br />
<p>
    The User-Experience Storyboard's flows of events can also be augmented with useability aspects. The remainder of this
    section provides a detailed example of how a flow of events could augmented with usability aspects.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
</p>
<p>
    The following is an example of an flow of events for a "Manage Incoming Mail Messages" Use Case, before it is augmented
    with usability aspects.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        a) The use case starts when the mail user requests to manage mail messages, and the system displays the messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        b) The mail user may then follow one or more of these steps:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            c) Arrange mail messages according to sender or subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            d) Read the text of a mail message.
        </p>
        <p>
            e) Save a mail message as a file.
        </p>
        <p>
            f) Save a mail-message attachment as a file.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        g) The use case is completed when the mail user makes a request to quit managing incoming mail messages.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This flow of events is then augmented with various usability aspects, such as <a href="#Desired_Guidance">desired
    guidance</a>, <a href="#Average_Attribute_Values_and_Volumes_of_Objects">average attribute values and volumes of
    objects</a>, and <a href="#Average_Action_Usage">average action usage</a> (see below). The <a href="#Resulting_Flow_of_Events">resulting flow of events</a> is also shown below.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Desired_Guidance" name="Desired_Guidance"></a>Usability Aspect: Desired Guidance
</h5>
<p>
    A really usable system not only helps the user by automating simple and repetitive tasks, but it also provides
    guidance, typically by (implicitly) providing information for the tasks which cannot be automated. Such guidance can
    for example be provided by "balloon help," or context derived on-screen help.<br />
     This important input to the design of the user interface should be represented by identifying the need for such
    desired guidance at specific points in the flow of events.
</p>
<p>
    The user-interface designer should walk through the flow of events, and consider the following issues at each step:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What guidance could the user possibly need?
    </li>
    <li>
        What guidance could the system possibly provide?
    </li>
    <li>
        What should be represented as desired guidance and what should not?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    From the flow of events, the basic functionality of the system can be identified. From the desired guidance, you should
    be able to identify "optional" functionality that is not crucial for the user to be able to carry out his work, but
    that might help him carry out the work by (implicitly) providing him with information that he needs. Thus, anything
    that could help you find such optional functionality should be represented as desired guidance. You should not,
    however, represent desired guidance that only identifies functionality we would find anyway, just by using good
    user-interface shaping practice (for example, don't represent that the system should give the user feedback on his
    operations, or show the user all the different options he has, etc.)
</p>
<p>
    Desired guidance can also be used to tell you what not to show, thus enabling you to shape the user interface so that
    the user doesn't get swamped by irrelevant information.
</p>
<p>
    Desired guidance in the flow of events is not "requirements" in the same way as the Use-Case flow of events -- it is
    more like "wants," or "nice-to-haves." When you identify and describe desired guidance, you should not think in terms
    of what the system shall eventually provide, but in terms of what the user might need in addition to that; otherwise,
    you restrict our thinking. So, remember that the desired guidance is not absolutely necessary, it is merely a means of
    increasing usability.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
</p>
<p>
    The following is an example of a flow of events for a "Manage Incoming Mail Messages" Use Case, augmented with desired
    guidance (within <font color="#ff0000">[]</font>).
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="example">
        a) The use case starts when the mail user requests to manage mail messages, and the system displays the messages.
        <font color="#ff0000">[The user should be able to differentiate between new, read, and unread messages; the user
        should also see the sender, subject, and priority of each message.]</font>
    </p>
    <p class="example">
        b) The mail user may then follow one or more of these steps:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p class="example">
            c) Arrange mail messages according to sender or subject.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            d) Read the text of a mail message.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            e) Save a mail message as a file.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            f) Save a mail-message attachment as a file. <font color="#ff0000">[The user should be able to see the file
            types of the attachments.]</font>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="example">
        g) The use case is complete when the mail user makes a request to quit managing incoming mail messages.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Desired guidance is often required in actions where the user has to make a decision. The following points often apply
    to such decisions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        They are non-trivial to the user.
    </li>
    <li>
        They impact peoples' life or businesses surrounding the system (peoples or businesses surrounding the system
        usually means the business, the user, and the task the user is trying to carry out.)
    </li>
    <li>
        They matter once the Use Case has terminated.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
</p>
<p>
    In the flow of events of the "Manage Incoming Mail Messages" Use Case, step f), to save an attachment, is an obvious
    decision made by the user. It therefore requires some guidance.

<h5>
    <a id="Average_Attribute_Values_and_Volumes_of_Objects" name="Average_Attribute_Values_and_Volumes_of_Objects"></a>Usability Aspect: Average Attribute Values and Volumes of
    Objects
</h5>
<p>
    It is often important to capture average attribute values and volumes of objects that need to be managed by, or
    presented to, the user. The user interface can then be optimized for these average values and volumes.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
</p>
<p>
    The following is an example of a flow of events for a "Manage Incoming Mail Messages" Use Case, augmented with average
    attribute values and volumes (within <font color="#008040">{ }</font>).
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        a) The use case starts when the mail user requests to manage mail messages, and the system displays the messages.
        <font color="#008040">{An average of 100 unread mail messages are shown simultaneously; and in 90% of the cases,
        the subject line of a message is less than 40 characters.}</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        b) The mail user may then follow one or more of these steps:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            c) Arrange mail messages according to sender or subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            d) Read the text of a mail message. <font color="#008040">{The message text contains 100 characters on
            average.}</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            e) Save a mail message as a file.
        </p>
        <p>
            f) Save a mail-message attachment as a file.<font color="#008040">{In 95% of the cases, there are less than two

<h5>
    <a id="Average_Action_Usage" name="Average_Action_Usage"></a>Usability Aspect: Average Action Usage
</h5>
<p>
    Average action usage is captured to find actions that are heavily used as opposed to actions that are seldom used. As a
    result, we will find both common and uncommon sequences (flows) through the Use Case. This is important information
    that can be used to prioritize and focus on intensively used parts of the user interface and its navigation hierarchies
    (for example, by providing shortcuts or additional toolbars in the user interface to perform common actions).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
</p>
<p>
    The following is an example of a flow of events for a "Manage Incoming Mail Messages" Use Case, augmented with average
    action usage (within <font color="#800080">()</font>).
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        a) The use case starts when the mail user requests to manage mail messages, and the system displays the messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        b) The mail user may then follow one or more of these steps:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            c) Arrange mail messages according to sender or subject. <font color="#800080">(Done in more than 60% of the
            cases.)</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            d) Read the text of a mail message. <font color="#800080">(Done in more than 75% of the cases.)</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            e) Save a mail message as a file. <font color="#800080">(Done in less than 5% of the cases.)</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            f) Save a mail-message attachment as a file.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        g) The use case is complete when the mail user makes a request to quit managing incoming mail messages.

<p>
    The conclusion from this description is that steps c) and d) need a thorough user-interface support.

<p>
    In summary, the User-Experience Storyboard flows of events describe the use-case flows of events in terms of
    User-Experience Elements. The flows of events may also be augmented with various usability aspects. This information is
    then used to design a usable user interface. Also note that the usability aspects as shown in the example above may be
    modified or extended with other aspects, depending on the needs of the particular application type or user-interface
    technology in use.

    Diagram(s)</a>
</h3>
<p>
    User-Experience Storyboard flow diagrams show how the flows of events are realized in terms of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/workproducts/user_experience_element_D76CBED9.html" guid="{359C3727-8E7C-4C08-BBAA-D428674CB552}">User-Experience Element</a>s. Each User-Experience Storyboard flow
    diagram expresses a flow of events in terms of User-Experience Elements (for information on identifying User-Experience
    Elements, see the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">Guideline: User-Experience Element</a>).
</p>
<p>
    User-Experience Storyboard flow diagrams are modeled as UML interaction diagrams (usually sequence diagrams), where the
    instances are User-Experience Elements (e.g.,&nbsp; screens and input forms).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    There should be (at least one) flow diagram for each of the associated <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_usecase_A5D30E62.html" guid="{B1526BC5-E346-42CB-A08A-3C0D7F382407}">Use
    Case</a>&nbsp;flows of events (one for the basic flow and one for each of the alternate flows).&nbsp; The flow diagrams
    usually begin when the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_actor_1F9CE9.html" guid="{0EEBBA43-F5C6-4594-9F06-65D99F7556DF}">Actor</a> requests something from the system, since an Actor always
    invokes the Use Case. The User-Experience Storyboard flow diagrams should be consistent with the associated Use-Case
    flow of events (and with any <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_use_case_realization_E4F713BD.html" guid="{87EB094F-095B-4981-ACC3-319B3B298641}">Use-Case Realization</a>s&nbsp;for the Use Case).&nbsp; However, in the
    slow diagrams, only the interactions between the user and the User-Experience Elements and between the User-Experience
    Elements themselves are modeled. Incidentally, these interactions correspond to the interactions between the Actor and
    the boundary <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_analysis_class_DAF7CE03.html" guid="{1E20603F-A5B8-42D5-BDBC-69DCE9C0FCDB}">Analysis Class</a>es in the Use-Case Realizations).
</p>
<p>
    The messages between the User Experience Element instances in the flow diagrams should be associated with operations
    (actions) on the recipient instance. In some cases, those operations reflect <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html#User Actions" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">user actions</a>, in other cases, they represent another User-Experience Element being
    rendered as a result of a user action (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html#Environment Actions" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">environment actions</a>). The goal is that all messages on the flow diagrams are
    associated with an action defined on the receiving User-Experience element.
</p>
<p>
    Notes, scripts, free text, guard conditions, etc. should be used to describe the flow, where it is not
    obvious/straightforward.&nbsp; If necessary, the flow diagrams may be further clarified by using the User-Experience
    Storyboard flow of events as a complementary textual description. In fact, the User-Experience Storyboard flow of
    events may be used as the script that appears on the left side of the User-Experience Storyboard sequence diagrams. For
    more information on the flows of events, see the <a href="#Describing_the_User_Experience_Storyboard_Flows_of_Events">Describing the User-Experience Storyboard Flows of
    Events</a> section.
</p>
<p>
    Even though the same User-Experience Element may appear multiple times in the same scenario, each and every time it
    appears, it represents a new "object" instance, one with a potentially different state.&nbsp; See the reflexive message
    discussion in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html#Modeling Navigation Paths" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">Guideline: User-Experience Element, Modeling Navigation Paths</a> for an example
    demonstrating multiple instances of the same User-Experience Element on a single interaction diagram.
</p>
<p>
    Note: There is no need to show a message from a screen to its contained input form as there is no navigation from the
    screen to the input form -- the input form is part of the screen and is rendered at the same time the screen is.
</p>
<p>
    The following diagram demonstrates the above guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Each message is associated with an action on the receiving screen.&nbsp; For example, create new account() is a
        possible user action on the home screen.&nbsp; That user action causes the new account screen to be displayed by
        the environment (note the static $navigate to() action defined for the new account screen).&nbsp; For more
        information on modeling actions, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html#Actions" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">Guideline: User-Experience Element</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are two instances of the home screen on the diagram, one unnamed and another,
        "withAccountCreatedActivationRequiredMsg", that contains the "a user account has been required, but requires
        activation" message.&nbsp; The content of these screens is the same, accept for a different status message.&nbsp;
        However, new message means new screen instance.&nbsp; For more information on modeling messages to the user see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html#Modeling Screen Messages" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">Guideline: User-Experience Elements</a>.

    The User-Experience Storyboard flow diagrams provide an excellent means to validate the navigation paths between the
    User-Experience Elements as depicted in the User-Experience Storyboard participants diagrams, and in the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/workproducts/user_experience_navmap_CF219DA6.html" guid="{C012CDE6-D566-4120-A518-13D1FD51D63E}">User-Experience Model Navigation Map</a>, as well as to ensure that the
    associated Use-Case flows of events have been accounted for. It is important to confirm that the defined
    User-Experience Elements support the flows of events and that the defined navigation paths are valid.&nbsp; For
    guidelines on modeling the participants diagram, see <a href="#Modeling_the_User_Experience_Storyboard_Participants_Diagram">Modeling the User-Experience Storyboard
    Participants Diagram</a> section. For guidelines on modeling the Navigation Map, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_navigation_map_21661284.html" guid="9.453117380007355E-306">Guideline: User-Experience Navigation Map</a>. For specific consistency rules that should
    be maintained between the flow diagrams and the participants diagram, see the "Diagram Consistency Rules" section of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/checklists/user_experience_storyboard_6286772C.html" guid="_ipQXMFkUEdq8uvFnmNBclw">Checklist: User-Experience Storyboard</a>.

<h3>
    <a id="Modeling_the_User_Experience_Storyboard_Participants_Diagram" name="Modeling_the_User_Experience_Storyboard_Participants_Diagram">Modeling the User-Experience Storyboard
    Participants Diagram</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of the User-Experience Storyboard participants diagram is to show the User-Experience Model elements that
    participate in the User-Experience Storyboard, with sufficient detail to accurately portray the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html#User Actions" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">user actions</a> and navigation paths that support the flows of events.
</p>
<p>
    There should be (at least one) participants diagram for each User-Experience Storyboard. If there are many
    participants, multiple diagrams may be used. The participants diagram(s) are local to the User-Experience Storyboard.
</p>
<p>
    For every message on the User-Experience Storyboard flow diagrams, there should be a supporting navigation association
    defined between the associated User-Experience Elements on the participants diagram.&nbsp; For example, if :ScreenA
    sends a message to :ScreenB, then a navigation association must be created from ScreenA to ScreenB.&nbsp; Where
    necessary, name and describe the navigation path. For specific modeling conventions and recommendations for navigation
    paths, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html#Navigation" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">Guideline: User-Experience Element, Navigation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The context for the participants diagram is a specific User-Experience Storyboard, unlike the context of the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/workproducts/user_experience_navmap_CF219DA6.html" guid="{C012CDE6-D566-4120-A518-13D1FD51D63E}">User-Experience Model Navigation Map</a>, which is the entire
    application. The participants diagram can be considered the navigation map for the User-Experience Storyboard. Thus,
    the User-Experience Storyboard participants diagram is a subset of the navigation map (it only contains the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/workproducts/user_experience_element_D76CBED9.html" guid="{359C3727-8E7C-4C08-BBAA-D428674CB552}">User-Experience Element</a>s involved in the User-Experience Storyboard
    and the navigation paths that support the User-Experience Storyboard flow diagrams).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Since a specific User-Experience Storyboard is the context for the participants diagram, there is an opportunity to
    provide more detail than what is practical in the navigation map (the number of User-Experience Storyboard participants
    is likely to be relatively small). Thus, in a User-Experience Storyboard participants diagram, the dynamic content
    (i.e., the attributes) and actions (operations) of the screens and input forms should be displayed.&nbsp; The
    participant diagram can be further customized by only displaying the dynamic content, actions, and navigation paths
    that directly support the User-Experience Storyboard.&nbsp; The project should define the level-of-detail required for
    the participants diagrams and document the results in the project-specific guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    With the dynamic content and the navigation paths displayed, it makes it easier to check for consistency between the
    user actions defined for a screen and the resulting navigation paths.&nbsp; For specific guidelines regarding screen
    navigation, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_element_F0023A91.html#Navigation" guid="9.763858677053972E-306">Guideline: User-Experience Element, Navigation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The User-Experience Storyboard participants diagram must be consistent with the User-Experience Storyboard flow
    diagrams.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/checklists/user_experience_storyboard_6286772C.html" guid="_ipQXMFkUEdq8uvFnmNBclw">Checklist: User-Experience Storyboard</a> for specific consistency rules.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The following diagram demonstrates the above guidelines and is consistent with the <a href="#Modeling_the_User_Experience_Storyboard_Flow_Diagrams">flow diagram</a> shown in the previous section:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Only the dynamic content, actions, and navigation paths that support the User-Experience Storyboard are displayed.
        Other details have been suppressed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Every navigation path is named so that it can easily be associated with a user action defined for the initiating
        screen (the names are similar).<br />
         Remember, every user action does not have to result in a navigation and every navigation is not necessarily the
        result of a user action.<br />
         For example, create new account() user action on the home screen and the "create new account" navigation from the
        home screen to the new account screen.
    </li>

<h3>
    <a id="Referring_to_Usability_Requirements" name="Referring_to_Usability_Requirements"></a>Referring to Usability
    Requirements
</h3>
<p>
    Usability requirements define how high the usability of the user interface must be.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to augmenting the User-Experience Storyboard flows of events with usability aspects, it is important to
    reference other usability requirements that affect the User-Experience Storyboard, as a whole. That way, all usability
    constraints on the User-Experience Storyboard (to be considered during user-interface prototyping and implementation)
    are "gathered" together.
</p>
<p>
    The following are examples of such general usability requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Maximum execution time - how long it should take a trained user to execute a common scenario.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maximum error rate - how many errors a trained user will average for a common scenario.<br />
         The only errors that are relevant to measure are those that are unrecoverable and will have negative effects on
        the organization, such as losing business, or causing damage to monitored hardware. If the only consequence of an
        error is that it takes time to fix, this will affect the measured execution time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Learning time - how long it takes before the user can execute a scenario faster than the specified maximum
        execution time.
    </li>
</ul>
