</p>
<h3>
    <a id="General Screen Guidelines" name="General Screen Guidelines">General Screen Guidelines</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Screens are modeled as classes with the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; stereotype.
</p>
<p>
    Every screen should have a name and a brief description.&nbsp; These are the two most important pieces of information
    about a screen. At a very high level they identify the screen's intent and scope. Optionally, a sketch of the GUI (in
    an appropriate format - BMP, JPEG) may be associated with the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt;.&nbsp; Such a sketch provides a
    graphical representation of the screen.
</p>
<p>
    The goal for modeling screens is that, when looking at a diagram containing the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class with all
    attributes and operations displayed, the following is apparent:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Exactly what <a href="#User Actions">user actions</a> can be performed on the screen. These are modeled as
        PUBLIC, NON-STATIC operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exactly what types of <a href="#Modeling Screen Messages">messages</a> can be displayed on the screen. These
        are modeled as PRIVATE, STATIC operations.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Exactly what <a href="#Dynamic Content">dynamic content</a> must be provided by the business logic. Dynamic
        content is modeled as private attributes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example, in the screen class shown below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The user actions that can be performed on the screen are: bid on item, display image, and display bid history
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The messages that can be displayed on the screen are a bid cancelled message and an auction closed message.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The dynamic content that must be provided by the business logic is: category name, item title, description,
            etc. (all the attributes).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For more information on each of these screen elements, see the specific sections below: <a href="#User Actions">user
    actions</a>, <a href="#Dynamic Content">dynamic content&nbsp;</a> and <a href="#Modeling Screen Messages">messages</a>).
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr17.gif" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    The following are some additional recommendations for screens:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Try to have ONE primary screen per Actor that either contains, or provides access to, all the User-Experience
        Elements the Actor is to interact with. It is important that the Actor spends a considerable part of his "use time"
        interacting with this primary screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each Actor should be related to only one screen (aggregate) representing the primary window.
    </li>
    <li>
        All Screens used by the same Actor should be related in some way, often via an aggregation hierarchy, starting with
        the primary screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        Aggregation hierarchies should be as wide and shallow as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Screens should, in general, be part of one (and-only one) aggregation hierarchy, so the Actor knows where to find
        it.
    </li>
    <li>
        There should be as few aggregation hierarchies as possible, because they complicate the Actors' mental model.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For some general guidelines on the creation of user-interfaces, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/user_interface_general_12B3C0B9.html" guid="6.780901688276357E-305">Guideline: User Interface (General)</a> ("screen" and "window" may be considered
    synonymous in the context of these guidelines).
</p>
<p>
    The screens should reflect the guidance provided in the project-specific guidelines.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Identifying Screens" name="Identifying Screens">Identifying Screens</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The following are some suggestions for identifying screens:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify one central screen representing the main screen with which a particular Actor interacts. The main screen
        should be the window that is opened when the user launches the application. It is normally always open as long as
        the application is running, and is the place where the user spends a considerable part of his "use time." Since it
        is always open and since it constitutes the user's first contact with the system, it is the foremost vehicle for
        enforcing the user's mental model of the system.<br />
         If such a class already exists, consider reusing it. This is because you should strive to minimize the number of
        primary screens a particular actor needs to interact with. However, you will, of course, have to compromise;
        primary screens should not be too complex or cluttered.<br />
         For example, for a web application, the central screen is the application's home screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        Look for functions the user will be performing in the system.<br />
         Identify one screen for each major system function (note: these major system functions should map to use
        cases).<br />
         For example, for an online auction application, some possible screens include: browse auction catalog, bid on
        item, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Look for information interesting to the user, information that is manipulated by the system, and information that
        needs to be visible and managed in the user interface.&nbsp; Some sources for such information is the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_glossary_A5D79A0C.html" guid="{3BF8CC04-9101-47A4-9473-C8205EA588B6}">Glossary</a>, <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_usecase_A5D30E62.html" guid="{B1526BC5-E346-42CB-A08A-3C0D7F382407}">Use
        Case</a>&nbsp;descriptions, and the key abstractions identified during <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/tasks/architectural_analysis_2B9BE03.html" guid="{8CB48402-D4C5-4E17-BB33-507315CB1BBF}">Task:
        Architectural Analysis</a>.<br />
         Note: Some of this information may end up being modeled as screens, where other information will just be modeled
        as dynamic content on another screen.&nbsp; See <a href="#Dynamic Content">Dynamic Content</a> for more
        information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some user actions may require a complex interaction with the user, thereby justifying a secondary screen of their
        own (e.g., a specific dialog box).&nbsp; For example, a Print user action on a screen, due to its complex
        interaction, justifies a separate dialog box.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each identified screen, provide a name and a brief description that conveys the screen's purpose and usage.&nbsp;
    Also, make a first pass at defining the <a href="#Dynamic Content">dynamic content</a> that is to be contained on the
    screen, as well as the <a href="#User Actions">user actions</a> that the user can perform on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If the user must enter information into the system, be sure to define the necessary <a href="#Input Forms">input
    form</a>s.&nbsp; Provide a brief description for identified dynamic content and user actions.&nbsp; Remember, the
    User-Experience Model is intended to be contract between the user-experience and the engineering teams, and the dynamic
    content is the key integration point.&nbsp; Thus, it is important that it is unambiguously documented.
</p>
<p>
    Strive to minimize the number of screens, thereby also minimizing the screen navigation paths. For more information on
    navigation paths, see <a href="#Navigation">Navigation</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Screen Content" name="Screen Content">Screen Content</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Screen content is the generic term for business information that appears on a screen. It is a combination of static
    content, dynamic content , and user-supplied content.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Static content</i> is information that is provided by the presentation logic (as opposed to the business logic) of
    the system. Some examples include: overall screen structure, field names, titles, text, images, client-side scripts,
    and client-side compiled elements that are constant for each user of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
     For a web application, static content is the information that is determined before the page is requested from the
    server.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
     Static content is not modeled as part of the&nbsp; &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Dynamic content</i> is the dynamic information provided by the business logic of the system, as opposed to the
    presentation logic.&nbsp; The values of the dynamic content can (and usually do) change for each user of the
    system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
     For a web application, dynamic content is determined (and supplied by the business logic) when the page is requested.
</p>
<p>
    Some examples of dynamic content include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        User session content (i.e. shopping cart items, search results)
    </li>
    <li>
        Application managed content (i.e. product descriptions, order status, inventory quantities)
    </li>
    <li>
        Messages to the user (e.g., "the entered data is invalid because ...")
    </li>
    <li>
        The time of day on the server
    </li>
    <li>
        other computed information.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Dynamic content is where the presentation world meets to engineering world. Dynamic content is the responsibility of
    the business logic team to produce, and the presentation logic/user-experience team to organize and present.&nbsp; For
    more information on dynamic content, see <a href="#Dynamic Content">Dynamic Content</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>User-supplied content</i> is entered via input forms that are part of a screen. For more information on modeling
    input forms, see <a href="#Input Forms">Input Forms</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Dynamic Content" name="Dynamic Content">Dynamic Content</a>
</h4>
<p>
    As described earlier, dynamic content is dynamic information provided by the business logic of the system, as opposed
    to the presentation logic. It is the responsibility of the business logic team to produce, and the
    presentation/user-experience team to display on a screen.&nbsp; It is available to the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/roles/rup_user_interface_designer_5C1ECFC9.html" guid="{0F994CCE-2B28-414A-9D31-DA23C13B95D4}">User-Interface Designer</a>when structuring the screen.
</p>
<p>
    Dynamic content is represented as attributes of the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class. Dynamic content represents the state
    of the screen.&nbsp; Since the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class is an analysis-level modeling element, expressing the
    dynamic content of the screen can be relatively free-formed. Strict data types and valid identifier names are not
    necessary to convey the dynamic content of the screen (such information is better expressed in the detailed <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_design_model_2830034D.html" guid="{8CDAEAD4-5E84-4F50-87FD-3240ED047DE7}">Design Model</a>. In the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/workproducts/user_experience_model_E11A34D3.html" guid="{34EE80D4-460E-494D-BC01-E34D5CB7756A}">User-Experience Model</a>, it is sufficient to identify the dynamic
    content by name and provide a short description.&nbsp; Data typing the attributes is optional and should only be done
    to help clarify the nature of the item, and should not be interpreted as a design model decision. Broad categories for
    dynamic content data types should be used (String, Numeric, Image, Date, Currency, etc.), instead of language specific
    types (i.e. Long, Short, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes the dynamic content is a little "richer" than a singular piece of content. In such cases, "<i>content
    bundles</i>" may need to be defined. For example: Think of a shopping cart screen. The dynamic content is the line
    items and total price. The total price is a singular piece of content. The line items, however, each contain a product
    id, name, quantity, unit price and line item total price (i.e., each line item contains multiple content pieces). There
    are zero or more line items in a shopping cart, and this multiplicity must be the same for all of the line item
    discrete pieces. For example you can't have two product ids, one product name, 6 quantities, etc. Thus, the line item
    content pieces are bundled together in a single class, so that a single multiplicity can be shared by all line item
    content pieces.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Content bundles</b> are modeled as a class(es), with the dynamic content of the bundled modeled as attributes of the
    class.&nbsp; A composition relationship is drawn from the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class to the content bundle
    class.&nbsp; A special stereotype is not defined and applied for these "content" bundles.&nbsp; However, they can
    always be recognized by their context - they are always owned by a screen.
</p>
<p>
    An example of a content bundle, active auction, is shown below.&nbsp; In this case, information on all auctions a user
    has open is displayed on the user's home screen.&nbsp; Every active auction has an item name, starting price, minimum
    bid increment, auction start date, auction end date, and an auction tracking number.
</p><img alt="UMA diagram" height="153" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr3.gif" width="490" border="0" /> 
<p>
    Content that has a variable number of elements (i.e., list content) can be expressed with array notation. Sometimes the
    content's multiplicity is variable, as might be seen in a product catalog with multiple categories of products. In this
    situation, the content attribute is represented with array notation, using a pair of square brackets after its name
    (i.e. [ ] ). See the figure below:
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" height="85" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr4.gif" width="88" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    The level of detail should be appropriate to the intended audience. If the audience is unfamiliar with UML, and is
    unlikely to adopt it, then it is best to eliminate some of the details, and use either array notation for bundled
    content or simply use plural terms, and ensure that the screen and attributes documentation describe the nature of the
    dynamic content sufficiently for the engineering and testing teams.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Input Forms" name="Input Forms">Input Forms</a>
</h3>
<p>
    An input form is a part of a screen that contains a collection of user input fields (i.e., user-supplied content).
    Input forms allow the user to enter information into the system.&nbsp; Input forms are processed by the application's
    business logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Input forms are modeled as classes with a stereotype of &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt;. The &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt;
    stereotype uses the possibly redundant term "input" to emphasize the role of the class it stereotypes -- it accepts
    user input. The name of the input form should reflect the data that is being entered on the form, and "form" should be
    included as the last word in the class name (e.g., "account info form").
</p>
<p>
    Input form fields are modeled as attributes on the &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; class, and can be specified with an
    optional data type indicating the type of input element (i.e. Text, TextArea, Radio, Checkbox, Select, File).
</p>
<p>
    Separate &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; classes are needed because they represent two very
    different things. One is application content (&lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class) and the other is user input (&lt;&lt;input
    form&gt;&gt; class). In many cases there will be a close correlation, but not always.
</p>
<p>
    A single screen can contain multiple input forms. The relationship between screens and their input forms is modeled as
    a composition relationship from the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class to the contained &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt;
    class(es).&nbsp; The composition representation emphasizes the ownership relationship between the
    &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; and the &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; (A screen "owns" its input forms; input forms always appear
    in the context of screens).
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr5.gif" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    It is also possible to show the &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; as a shared class, being contained by multiple
    &lt;&lt;screens&gt;&gt;.<br />
    <br />
     Note: The sharing of &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; classes between &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; classes is not recommended.
    That is not to say that there won't be some reuse of screen element during design. It's just that if the same
    &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; class is used by multiple screens, there may be hesitation to alter the &lt;&lt;input
    form&gt;&gt; class content because it affects other &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; classes, even though altering it is the
    right thing to do. Introducing too much "reuse" at this time (early analysis) may artificially constrain the
    User-Interface Designer.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr18.gif" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    If an input form is not going to be shared across screens, the &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; class may be modeled as a
    nested class (nested within the "parent" &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class).
</p>
<p>
    If an input form needs to be pre-populated with default values that the user can then change, the following should be
    <a style="mso-comment-reference: KAH_1">modeled</a>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class that contains attributes for the values that must be pre-populated. The default
        values are considered dynamic content for the screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        An &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; that is "owned" by the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class (i.e., there is a composition
        relationship from the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; to the &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt;). As described earlier, the fields
        that the user can enter data into are modeled as attributes of the &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt;.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each of the &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; fields that require default data should have an associated
        &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class attribute.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These modeling recommendations are demonstrated in the following diagram.&nbsp; In this diagram, the manage account
    screen contains an input form where the user can enter the account information to be changed.&nbsp; The input form is
    to be pre-populated with user's existing account information.&nbsp; Thus, input form fields are defined on the
    &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; class for the information to be entered by the user, and dynamic content is defined on the
    &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class for those input form fields for which default content is to be provided (username, email,
    creditname, etc.).&nbsp; Notice, no default value will be provided for the user's email address.

<p>
    Actions are things that can be done to a User-Experience Element.&nbsp; Actions are modeled as operations on the
    User-Experience Elementclasses.&nbsp; There are two categories of actions, <a href="#User Actions">user actions</a>
    and <a href="#Environment Actions">environment actions</a>.&nbsp; Each of these is discussed in more detail below.

</p>
<p>
    A user action is a user's request for an action by the system. User actions define how the user interacts with the
    screen (i.e., user actions are those things that a user can "do" to the screen or input form).&nbsp; A user action is
    different than entering information into an input form. Some options for user actions include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Buttons on the screen
    </li>
    <li>
        Menu items on the screen
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When identifying user actions, look for requests the user makes of the system, including responses to requests made by
    the system to the user.
</p>
<p>
    Also, if a screen is to contain a large amount of information, some additional user actions may need to be defined to
    manipulate the large information set.&nbsp; Some examples of such user actions may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        User actions for searching the information set.
    </li>
    <li>
        User actions for sorting the information set.
    </li>
    <li>
        User actions for browsing hierarchies within the information set.
    </li>
    <li>
        User actions for selecting multiple items in the information set.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Refer to <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/user_interface_general_12B3C0B9.html" guid="6.780901688276357E-305">Guideline: User Interface (General)</a> for more detail.
</p>
<p>
    <a id="Modeling User Actions" name="Modeling User Actions"><b>Modeling User Actions</b></a>
</p>
<p>
    A user action is modeled as an operation on the User-Experience Model element class (e.g., &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; or
    &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; class). The name of the operation should reflect the user action.
</p>
<p>
    The modeling of user actions is demonstrated in the following diagram.&nbsp; The item detail screen contains
    information on an item that is available for auction.&nbsp; The actions the user may perform on the screen are: placing
    a bid on the item (bid on item()), displaying the bid history (display bid history()), or display the image of the item
    (display image()).
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr10.gif" border="0" />
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Environment Actions" name="Environment Actions">Environment Actions</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Environment actions are those actions that the "environment", as opposed to the user, performs on a screen (for a web
    application, the "environment" is the web browser).&nbsp; Since the User-Experience Model is an analysis-level model,
    we don't want to get too carried away with modeling things that the environment does (during user-experience modeling,
    we are mostly concerned with things that the user does).&nbsp; However, the fact that screens are created/displayed is
    important in analysis. We just don't care how it is done.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Thus, screen creation/rendering is modeled using static operations on the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class (the operation
    is underlined).&nbsp; Input forms are assumed to be created when their "owning" &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class is
    created, so static operations are not modeled for &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; classes.
</p>
<p>
    The environment supports the user's navigation to a screen and the display of a message on a screen (for web
    applications, the screen content is prepared on the server for display/rendering on the client).&nbsp; In both cases,
    the end result is a screen being created/rendered for display.&nbsp; Thus, there are two types of static operations
    that usually get modeled for &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; classes, "navigate to" and "display" operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    In general, all &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; classes should contain a "navigate to()" operation.&nbsp; If a message needs to
    be displayed on a screen, then the screen should contain a "display()" operation, one for each message to be
    displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
     Note: Some additional modeling is required for screen messages.&nbsp; For more information on modeling screen
    messages, see <a href="#Modeling Screen Messages">Modeling Screen Messages</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The use of both the navigate to() and display() operations are shown in the following diagrams.&nbsp; In this example,
    there is a screen that contains information for an item that is available for auction.&nbsp; A request to bid on the
    item can be requested from the screen.&nbsp; The Buyer requests to bid on the item whose information is displayed, but
    the auction has already closed.&nbsp; The environment supports the navigation to a new instance of the item detail
    screen that contains an "auction closed" message.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr17.gif" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/bidonitem_sb.gif" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    The rationale for using static operations to model the displaying of messages to the user is that the displaying of a
    message on a screen involves the rebuilding of the screen (another screen instance) that contains the message. A client
    merely browses (navigates to a screen); the infrastructure/system displays the message when the page is rendered.<br />
     Static operations are used to model actions that are performed by "the system", as opposed to the user. These actions
    are performed while the screen content is being prepared on the server for rendering on the client. Such operations are
    "creative" in nature, hence the use of the static UML adornment.
</p>
<p>
    Some may argue that environment actions do not need to be modeled at all since creation/navigation to necessary for all
    screens. However, modeling environment actions as operations allows the User-Interface Designer to associate messages
    on interaction diagrams with these operations and results in more readable interaction diagrams.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Modeling the explicit display() messages allows you to model all the possible messages that a screen can display. This
    is not (visually) captured anywhere else. You may not be able to get this information from anywhere else, as it is
    possible to define general "status" message dynamic content fields<font color="#0000ff" size="2">.</font>
</p>
<p>
    Additional guidelines for modeling screen messages is provided <a href="#Modeling Screen Messages">below</a>, as
    well as in the context of developing the interaction diagrams contained within the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/workproducts/user_experience_storyboard_49E2F5E1.html" guid="{7346D963-ECD9-4D3F-B633-E429B43B7BD7}">User-Experience Storyboard</a>s.

</h4>
<p>
    Some <a href="#User Actions">user action</a>s defined for the User-Experience Elements result in the navigation from
    one element to another (and thus a navigation association in the navigation map). However, every user action does not
    have to result in a navigation and every navigation is not necessarily the result of a user action.&nbsp; <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/workproducts/user_experience_storyboard_49E2F5E1.html" guid="{7346D963-ECD9-4D3F-B633-E429B43B7BD7}">User-Experience Storyboard</a>s provide additional clues as to what
    navigation paths need to be defined. If the storyboard flow diagrams show a navigation from one element to another,
    then a navigation association should be defined between the elements in the navigation map. For more information on
    storyboard flow diagrams, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/user_experience_storyboard_CCF3852D.html" guid="1.795569619094057E-305">Guideline: User-Experience Storyboard</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Strive to minimize the number of navigation paths. In addition to adding needless interaction overhead, screen
    navigation paths that are too long make it more likely that the user will "get lost" in the system. Ideally, all
    screens should be "navigate-able to" from a main screen, resulting in a maximum screen navigation length of two. Try to
    avoid screen navigation lengths greater than three.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Modeling Navigation Paths" name="Modeling Navigation Paths">Modeling Navigation Paths</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Navigation between User-Experience Elements is modeled as a directed association relationship from the source
    User-Experience Element to the destination User-Experience Element (e.g., the screen being navigated to).&nbsp; The
    direction of the navigation can be specified using the navigability property of the association.
</p>
<p>
    For navigation resulting from a <a href="#User Actions">user action</a>, the navigation association name should
    reflect the user action that causes the navigation.&nbsp; The following are some suggestions for naming the navigation
    association:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When the user action only has only one possible outcome (e.g.,&nbsp; a link/navigate to another screen), the
        relationship name should match the user action (e.g., "browse auction catalog").
    </li>
    <li>
        When the user action has multiple possible outcomes (e.g.,&nbsp; enter information into a form that needs to be
        validated), the relationship name should reflect both the user action, as well as the outcome (e.g., "invalid bid
        submitted", or "items found").
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Not all navigation associations need names. Only name the associations when the names add to the understanding of the
    diagram (i.e., when the reason for the navigation is not obvious, either from the context or the classes on either end
    of the association).
</p>
<p>
    An example of when a navigation association name would be needed is if there are multiple user actions (operations)
    defined for a &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class, and there are multiple outgoing associations.&nbsp; In such a case, without
    navigation names, it would be difficult to tell which navigation paths were associated with which user actions.&nbsp;
    This situation is demonstrated in the following diagram (notice the multiple user actions and outgoing navigation paths
    for the bid confirmation input form).:
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" height="277" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr16.gif" width="910" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    An example of when a navigation association name would not be needed is if there is a screen that contains only one
    user action and only has one outgoing navigation association.&nbsp; In such a case, it would be fairly easy to
    associate the single outgoing navigation path with the single user action.&nbsp; This situation is demonstrated in the
    following diagram:
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr15.gif" border="0" /><br />
</p>
<p>
    Where an input form is the source of the navigation (i.e., when the user submitting information entered on an input
    form is what causes the navigation), the navigation association should be drawn from the &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt;
    class to the destination &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class. The intent of having the form be the source of the navigation is
    to show which form's values were being submitted for processing. This is important to emphasize because a screen can
    contain multiple input forms, each submitting themselves separately.
</p>
<p>
    There is no navigation from the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; to it's contained &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; classes -- the
    &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; is rendered at the same time the &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; is.
</p>
<p>
    The following example demonstrates the navigability guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        From a screen containing the details of an item available for auction (item detail &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class),
        the user may request to bid on the item (bid on item() operation).
    </li>
    <li>
        When a bid on item user action is entered, if it is accepted, a screen is displayed ("bid on item accepted"
        navigation association) where the user can enter bid information (bid on item &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class and
        contained bid information form &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; class).
    </li>
    <li>
        When a bid on item user action is entered, if it is not accepted because the auction is closed, the item detail
        screen is re-displayed with an "auction closed" message.
    </li>
    <li>
        a screen is displayed ("bid on item accepted" navigation association) where the user can enter bid information (bid
        on item &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class and contained bid information form &lt;&lt;input form&gt;&gt; class).
    </li>
    <li>
        If the user submits valid bid information (submit bid() operation), the bid results screen is displayed ("valid bid
        submitted" navigation association)
    </li>
    <li>
        If the user submits invalid bid information (submit bid() operation), the bid on item screen is re-displayed with
        an "invalid bid" message, so the user can enter valid information ("invalid bid submitted" navigation association).
    </li>
    <li>
        If the user cancels the bid information (cancel bid() operation), the item detail screen is redisplayed with a "bid
        cancelled" message ("bid cancelled" navigation association).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_scr14.gif" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    Reflexive navigation associations can be defined for screens. Reflexive navigation associations indicate that the user
    can navigate from one instance of the screen to another instance of the screen, perhaps with some changed/additional
    information (when the information on a screen changes, another instance of the screen is created).
</p>
<p>
    The following diagrams illustrate the use of reflexive screen navigation associations.&nbsp; A reflexive navigation
    association, "bid on item auction closed" is defined.&nbsp; The name of the association associates the navigation with
    the user action, bid on item().&nbsp; The way to interpret this model fragment is that when the user requests to bid on
    and item for which the auction is closed, the original item detail screen is re-displayed (a new instance of the screen
    is created) with an "auction closed" message.
</p>

    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_uxm4.gif" border="0" />

<p>
    The User-Interface Designer defines the valid navigation paths between the screens.&nbsp; The defined navigation paths
    must support the execution of the Use Cases.&nbsp; This is validated in the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.ux_model/workproducts/user_experience_storyboard_49E2F5E1.html" guid="{7346D963-ECD9-4D3F-B633-E429B43B7BD7}">User-Experience Storyboard</a>s.

    navigation map diagrams display the structure of the User-Experience Model.&nbsp;&nbsp;For information on the

</h3>
<p>
    When a message needs to be displayed on a screen, the following should be modeled:
</p>
<p>
    For the screen where the message is to be displayed:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Define an attribute with a name that reflects the type of message that is to be displayed. The name should be not
        be the same as the message content (the message content is considered dynamic).<br />
         For example: "<i>bid status msg</i>".
    </li>
    <li>
        Define a static public "navigate to" operation.<br />
         For example: "<i>+ navigate to()</i>". If you remember from earlier, it is recommended that every
        &lt;&lt;screen&gt;&gt; class have a navigate to() operation defined.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Define a static private operation with a name that explicitly identifies the message to be displayed.<br />
         For example: "<i>- display auction closed msg()</i>".<br />
         All display messages should be private and are only executed as a result of a navigate to() message. Some may
        argue that the display operations don't even need to be modeled (just annotate using UML notes). However, modeling
        the display messages allows the User-Interface Designer to see exactly what messages are required to be displayed
        on the screen, without having to look at all of the interaction diagrams.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The following example demonstrates the use of these guidelines:
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="UMA diagram" src="./../../../extend.ux_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/md_uxm3.gif" border="0" />
</p><br />
<br />
<p>
    To model the displaying of the message on an interaction diagram:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Draw a message to the screen where the message is to be displayed. Associate the message with the <i>navigate
        to()</i> operation (see #2 above)&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        On the screen where the message is to be displayed, draw a reflexive message. Associate the message with the
        private <i>display()</i> message with the explicit name (see #3 above).
    </li>
</ol>

    Special requirements of User-Experience Elements can be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        References to existing usability requirements, like user execution times, maximum number of mouse clicks, learning
        times, and error rates associated with the User-Experience Element.
    </li>
    <li>
        References to non-functional requirements that need to be handled when the corresponding user interface is designed

        specific component, such as an ActiveX control.
    </li>
    <li>
        References to dynamic content data volumes, like the ability to handle content within a specified range (e.g., a
